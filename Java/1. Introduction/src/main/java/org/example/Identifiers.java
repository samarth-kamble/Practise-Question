    * Identifiers :-
    * An identifier in Java is the name given to Variables, Classes, Methods, Packages, Interfaces, etc.
    * These are the unique names used to identify programming elements.
    * Every Java Variable must be identified with a unique name.
    *
    * Reserved Words :-
    * Any programming language reserves some words to represent functionalities defined by that language.
    * These words are called reserved words.
    * They can be briefly categorized into two parts:
    * Keywords (50): Keywords define functionalities.
    * literals (3): Literals define value. The three literals are, true, false and null.
